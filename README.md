# CSA-Project-A

Running the program

The entry point of the program is `main.py`

Ensure `ENABLE_SS` and `ENABLE_FS` are `True`

Additional testcases can be added within the `Testcases/` folder. Setting the `TC_NUMBER` to the required test # will run that particular test case.

**NOTE:**
The same output file names are used for all test cases. 
Only the `PerformanceMetrics_Results_{TC_NUMBER}.txt` has a unique name
